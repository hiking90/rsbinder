## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Parcel array decoding now distinguishes a null array (length `-1`) from an
  empty array (length `0`): an empty `Vec<T>` no longer deserializes as `None`,
  and a non-null `Vec<T>` rejects a null array with `UnexpectedNull` instead of
  silently yielding an empty vector. Matches AOSP `Parcel` decoding. (#162)
- Nullable decoders reject malformed sentinels instead of treating them as
  null/present: `String16` accepts only `-1` for null, and parcelable /
  `ParcelableHolder` presence accepts only `0` (null) / `1` (non-null). Other
  values now surface `UnexpectedNull`. (#162)
- Binder reply status handling aligned with AOSP: malformed status /
  remote-stack-trace reply headers now report `Unknown` (AOSP `UNKNOWN_ERROR`)
  rather than `BadValue`, `BR_TRANSACTION_PENDING_FROZEN` is treated as a
  successful oneway completion, and driver `errno` values are normalized to
  negative `status_t` form so callers never observe positive `errno`s. (#162)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-15

The headline of this release is a complete **RPC transport** (binder over
sockets) — a separate, opt-in stack alongside the existing kernel binder
support — together with first-class macOS support, a substantially expanded
Android compatibility surface, AIDL compiler improvements, and a large body of
correctness work from several review and audit rounds.

### Added

#### RPC transport (binder-over-socket) — new opt-in subsystem

A pure-Rust binder-over-socket stack, wire-compatible with Android's
`libbinder` RPC and kept entirely separate from the kernel binder path. It is
off by default and zero-cost when disabled, enabled via the `rpc` master
feature with per-backend opt-ins (`rpc-tcp-debug`, `rpc-vsock`, `rpc-tls`).

- `RpcServer` / `RpcSession`: multi-session serving, threading, version
  negotiation, and oneway / nested-call / timeout handling, plus
  `RpcServer::set_max_connections`.
- Transports: Unix socket, in-memory, debug TCP, vsock, and TLS (rustls) —
  including server-side TLS over unix/TCP/vsock and client mTLS.
- Wire compatibility: android-13+ versioned wire and android-16 RPC v2,
  validated against real `libbinder`.
- FD-over-RPC (`FileDescriptorTransportMode`), AOSP-faithful.
- Multi-connection session pool with per-node async ordering and AOSP
  `timesSent` / excess-`DEC_STRONG` accounting.
- RPC Accessor (`IAccessor`): both the client (consume) and registration
  sides, plus VINTF accessor integration in `rsb_hub`.
- Cross-transport calling identity and authorization: an injectable
  `PermissionAuthority`, a transport-tagged `Caller`, and a cross-transport
  service facade.
- RPC death notification and an async-over-RPC adapter.

#### Platform support

- First-class **macOS** support for the RPC stack (peer-credential authorizer,
  target-gated platform code). Kernel-binder-only APIs return
  `InvalidOperation` on macOS.

#### Android compatibility

- Calling identity: `get_calling_sid` / `get_calling_uid` / `get_calling_pid`,
  `clear_calling_identity` / `restore_calling_identity`, strict-mode policy,
  and `android.os.IPermissionController` (`check_permission`).
- `@EnforcePermission` code generation (`Single` / `AllOf` / `AnyOf`).
- Extended error reporting (`binder_extended_error` via `get_extended_error`),
  `FLAG_UPDATE_TXN`, and AppOps reply-header handling.
- Real-time priority inheritance (`FLAT_BINDER_FLAG_INHERIT_RT`, opt-in via
  `BinderFeatures`).
- Proxy-count infrastructure (global and per-uid counters with watermark
  callbacks).
- `Binder::attach_object` / `find_object` / `detach_object`,
  `LazyServiceRegistrar`, and an `IMemory` skeleton.
- Freeze-notification kernel UAPI baseline.

#### AIDL compiler (rsbinder-aidl)

- Generated `getInterfaceVersion()` / `getInterfaceHash()` meta methods
  (AIDL `--version` / `--hash`).
- `@Backing` type validation with AOSP-faithful diagnostics.
- Richer miette diagnostics (e.g. dedicated direction/primitive errors) and an
  AOSP fixture sweep.

#### Service manager (rsb_hub)

- Lazy-service poller and client-callback support.
- Accessor registration and VINTF integration.

### Changed

- Replaced the unmaintained `rustls-pemfile` with `rustls-pki-types`
  `PemObject`.
- Reduced redundant clones across the binder hot paths.
- Bumped `rsproperties` to 0.5, plus `log`, `similar`, and the dependabot
  `rust-major` / `rust-minor` dependency groups.
- Extensive documentation work: mdBook overhaul, API-doc sync, and
  cross-transport / RPC-TLS guides.

### Fixed

A large body of correctness work from multiple review and audit rounds
(PRs #147–#155). Highlights:

- `Parcel::append_from` no longer double-closes a file descriptor or
  underflows a refcount on an error path, and parcel write paths never read or
  transmit uninitialized bytes.
- `wait_for_response` no longer hangs the caller on a malformed `BR_REPLY`
  (`TF_STATUS_CODE` with an OK status).
- RPC: roll back `timesSent` and the oneway `async_number` reservation when a
  send fails; reject truncated `SCM_RIGHTS` fd batches (`MSG_CTRUNC`) instead
  of silently dropping fds.
- AIDL: reject operator-chain input that would overflow the parser stack,
  unresolvable constant references, and out-of-range shifts; `r#`-escape
  type-level names that are Rust keywords.
- `rsb_hub`: bound per-name registries and de-duplicate callback death links.
- `proxy_count`: decide per-object whether to track a proxy so toggling
  tracking no longer desyncs the count.
- Migrated `getrandom::getrandom` to `getrandom::fill` for getrandom 0.4.
- Various test fixes (WIBinder upgrade after obituary, process-wide thread-pool
  counter, RPC lifecycle flake).

### Security

- Addressed RUSTSEC-2025-0134 by replacing `rustls-pemfile` with
  `rustls-pki-types`.
